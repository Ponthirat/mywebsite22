# Analysis of movies - IMDB dataset

```{r,load_movies}
movies <- read.csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))

```

## Data Cleaning
Firstly, we must inspect the data to see if there are missing values.
```{r count_NA, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
count_NA <- sum(is.na(movies)) #counting all the NAs
count_NA
duplicated_count <- sum(duplicated(movies)) #counting all the duplicated
duplicated_count
```


## Table 1: Showing the count of movies by genre.
```{r table}
movie_table<- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  count(genre) #grouping by genre, then counting.
arrange(movie_table, desc(n))
```

## Table 2: Return on Budget

```{r table_2}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarize(return_on_budget = (mean(gross)/mean(budget))) %>%  #creating a new column called return_on _budget
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
  
```
We can see that Musical has the highest return on budget at 28.9, followed by Family which had a return on budget at 10.1. Whereas Thriller has the least return on budget at 0.0008.

## Table 3: Table Ranking Directors with the highest gross revenue
```{r Table_3}
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(gross),
            mean = mean(gross), 
            median = median(gross), 
            std = sd(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sum)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 15)
```

## Relationship between Variables

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross))+ 
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method ='lm')
```
We put "cast_facebook_likes" into the X axis and "gross" to the Y axis. There is a slight positive correlation between 'gross' and 'cast_facebook_like', although there exist many outliers, such as when likes is less than 100. Therefore, the cast is not likely to be a good predictor. However, many data points lies outside the a line of best fit, therefore, we cannot say with good confidence that it is a good predictor.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
  ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE)+ 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  labs(title='relationship between budget and gross')
```
Budget appears to be a good predictor of grossing, since the graph shows shows a positive correlation. Although when the budget is less than 1 million dollars, it is not a good predictor.


```{r, gross_on_rating}
  ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross))+ 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method='lm')+ 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  facet_wrap(~genre) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = 'Relationship between Rating and Gross for each genre')
```
Generally, some genre have much more rating than others,for instance, crime, documentary, and mystery. The others, however, have significantly less reviews. For those with high numbers of reviews, such as Action, Adventure, there exist positive correlation between gross and rating which makes IMDB rating a good predictor for those movies.

## Analysis of Directors
```{r movies}
movies_2 <- movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) %>% 
  summarise(rating,mean_rating = mean(rating), #find datapoints needed for t distribution.
         sd_rating = sd(rating),
         count=n(),
         t_critical =qt(0.975,count-1),
         se_rating = sd(rating)/sqrt(count),
         margin_of_error = t_critical*se_rating, 
         rating_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error, 
         rating_high = mean_rating +margin_of_error,
         highest_rating =max(rating),
         lowest_rating = min(rating))

#movies_mean<-count(movies, mean_rating) 
#movies_mean
movies_2

  ggplot(movies_2, aes(x = mean_rating,y = director))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(data = movies_2,aes(xmin = rating_low, xmax=rating_high,height=0.2))+
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",title = "Do Spielburg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating",subtitle="95% confidence interval overlap")+
    geom_rect(aes(xmin=7.27, xmax= 7.34, ymin=-Inf, ymax=Inf),
            fill = "grey50",
            colour = NA,
            alpha = 0.2)
```

```{r}
t.test(rating~director, data = movies_2) #find t-stat, p-value

#simulating a null world using infer()
set.seed(1234)
ratings_in_null_world <- movies_2 %>%
  specify(rating~director) %>% # we want to look at ratings of directors
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%  # hypothesize that the difference is 0
  generate(reps=1000, type="permute") %>% # create a bunch of simulated samples
  calculate(stat="diff in means", order = c("Steven Spielberg","Tim Burton")) # find difference in means of each sample. 

#ratings_in_null_world visualize, with shaded p value
ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = 0.64, direction = "two-sided")

 # finding p-value of simulated distribution
p_value <- ratings_in_null_world%>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = .64, direction = "two-sided")
p_value

```
